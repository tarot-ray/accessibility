# Joomla Accessibility Guidelines
## What is this?
We want to create a set of simple accessibility guidelines for designers of Joomla-based websites, for developers of extensions and templates. 

## Get involved
You can also help. The Joomla Accessible Team needs your time and talent.
Authors, editors, correctionists, documentalists - anyone can help. 
Joomla means "all together". Together we will achieve our goal more quickly. 

Create new guideline. Suggest changes. Correct errors. Develop a better version of an existing part. Add illustrations, examples. Report a fault. Suggest new topics.
