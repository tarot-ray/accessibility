# All functionality must be accessible from the keyboard

## Why?
Some users navigate the Internet without a mouse, just using the keyboard or keyboard interfaces. 

Such people include people with physical disabilities, blind people who do not see the mouse pointer, people with chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonâ€™s disease or repetitive stress injuries. These are also people with temporary limitations, e.g. a broken arm or a damaged mouse.

When functionalities are accessible from the keyboard, they are also accessible for assistive technologies, such as screen readers, as well as alternative interfaces, such as voice commands, gestures, and more. 

## How?
* **Provide event handling independent of the device**
  - When possible, use device independent event handlers. 
  - When you are using device dependent event handlers, use both mouse dependent and keyboard dependent event handlers (`onMouseOver`, `onMouseOut` and `onFocus`, `onBlur`).
  - When using the `onClick` event for custom elements (not links, buttons, etc.), ensure that Enter and Space keystrokes are detected.
  - Do not use the `onDblClick` event - there is no device independent handling or keyboard equivalent of this event.
  - Make sure that `onChange` and `onSelect` events do not cause unexpected results and accessibility problems.
* **Use recommended keyboard support patterns, in custom user interface elements** 
  - If you program custom user interface elements - e.g. accordion, carousel, dropdown menu, tabs - implement keyboard support, as recommended in the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices)
  - If you are building a website make sure that controls can be operated using the keyboard and avoid using components, modules, plugins, widgets, or JavaScript techniques which cannot be operated via the keyboard.
* **Keep the focus visible**
  - Provide visibility of the focus. 
  - If you are attaching the events to a different type of element, like a `<div>` or `<span>`, you need to enable the element, to receive keyboard focus. 
* **Ensure logical focus order of interactive elements**
  - Ensure that tabbing order, through active elements, is logical and matches visual layout.
  - If you program complex user interface components, use appropriate focus management techniques ([using a roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex) or [using aria-activedescendant](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_focus_activedescendant)).
  - Avoid changing focus unexpectedly.

## Navigating a website with the keyboard
* Use **Tab** or **Shift + tab**  keys to navigate forward or backward between all of the links and forms controls on the page.
* Use **Arrow** keys to navigate within complex components of the page, such as dropdown lists, accordions, slideshow, etc. 
* Use **Enter** key to execute the links.
* Use **Enter** or **Space** keys to activate buttons.
* Use **Esc** key to close the modal window.
